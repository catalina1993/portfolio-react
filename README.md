Elena Ispas – Personal Portfolio

🚀 A fully responsive portfolio built with React and custom CSS

Overview

This is my personal portfolio, designed and developed to showcase my work as a Front-End Developer and UI/UX Designer. It was built from scratch using React and custom CSS, without relying on Bootstrap or any UI frameworks. My goal was to create a clean, modern, and fully responsive design that reflects my style and attention to detail.

Tech Stack
	•	React – Built as a Single Page Application (SPA)
	•	Custom CSS – No Bootstrap, Tailwind, or UI libraries—just handcrafted styles
	•	React Router – Handles navigation for a seamless user experience
	•	Netlify – Deployed and hosted for easy access

Features

✅ Fully responsive across all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile)
✅ Smooth navigation with React Router
✅ Clean, minimal, and accessible UI
✅ Custom animations for an engaging experience
✅ Project showcase with GitHub and live demo links

Challenges & Lessons Learned

Building this portfolio was an exciting yet challenging experience. Some key struggles I faced:

1️⃣ Custom Styling & Responsiveness – Without Bootstrap or Tailwind, I had to manually fine-tune every layout, ensuring a seamless experience across different screen sizes. Media queries became my best friend.

2️⃣ Dark Mode Contrast & Readability – Since my portfolio has a dark theme, getting the right contrast for text, buttons, and images required a lot of trial and error to maintain both aesthetic appeal and accessibility.

3️⃣ React Router Issues – Handling dynamic routing without a full page refresh and ensuring smooth transitions between pages was tricky at first, but I managed to get it working flawlessly.

4️⃣ Performance Optimization – I had to make sure that my assets (like images) were properly optimized to prevent slow loading times, especially on mobile devices.

Future Improvements

💡 Adding light/dark mode toggle
💡 Enhancing animations for a more interactive experience
💡 Implementing a contact form with backend functionality
